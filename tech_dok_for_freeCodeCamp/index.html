                <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
                <p>It is used for:</p>
                <ul class="main-section_list">
                    <li>web development (server-side)</li>
                    <li>software development</li>
                    <li>mathematics</li>
                    <li>system scripting</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What can Python do?</h3>
                <ul class="main-section_list">
                    <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                    <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                    <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                    <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                    <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Python?</h3>
                <ul class="main-section_list"> 
                    <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
                    <li>ython has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                    <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
                    <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                    <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
                    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
                    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                    <code>
                        if 5 > 2: <br>
                        &nbsp print("Five is greater than two!")
                    </code>
                <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
                    <code>
                        if 5 > 2: <br>
                        print("Five is greater than two!")
                    </code>
            <p>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Python_Comments">
                <header class="main-section_header">Python Comments</header>
                <p>Comments starts with a <span class="spec-symbol">#</span>, and Python will ignore them:</p>
                    <code>
                        #This is a comment <br>
                        print("Hello, World!") <br>
                        print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
                    </code>
                <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                    To add a multiline comment you could insert a <span class="spec-symbol">#</span> for each line.
                    Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
                    Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
                    you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
                </p>
                    <code>
                        """  <br>
                        This is a comment <br>
                        written in <br>
                        more than just one line <br>
                        """ <br>
                        print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
                <p>As long as the string is not assigned to a variable,
                    Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
                <header class="main-section_header">Python Variables </header>
                <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
                    <code>
                        x = 5 <br>
                        y = "John" <br>
                        print(x) <br>
                        print(y)  
                    </code>
                <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Python_Numbers">
                <header class="main-section_header">Python Numbers </header>
                <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
                <ul class="main-section_list red">
                    <li>int</li>
                    <li>float</li>
                    <li>complex</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
                
                    <code>
                        x = 1    # int <br>
                        y = 2.8  # float <br>
                        z = 1j   # complex 
                    </code>
                
                <p>To verify the type of any object in Python, use the <span class="spec-symbol">type()</span> function.</p>
